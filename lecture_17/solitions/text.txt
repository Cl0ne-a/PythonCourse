 This code defines a function called plus_one that takes a single argument number and returns that number plus. Then, the code creates a new variable called add_one and assigns it the value of the plus_one function. This means that add_one now refers to the same function as plus_one. Finally, the code calls the add_one function with an argument of which returns. In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be assigned to variables just like any other value. â€¢ This allows us to create aliases for functions, like add_one in this example.
